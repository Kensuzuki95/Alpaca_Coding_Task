# Alpaca_Coding_Task

This repository show my work on the assigned task.

The K-Means_Function.ipynb file shows a function to impliment k-menas clustering on a 2-D datapoints dataset of your choice. You can modify the number of clusters to create for the dataset, and there will be a visual output of the clustering. 

Time took to write the `modified` codes: approx. 30 min (50 min for the intialy submitted codes)
